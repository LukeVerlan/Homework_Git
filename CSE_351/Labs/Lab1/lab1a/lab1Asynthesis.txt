1) Steps: 

First the pointers needed to point to the same index, the easiest way to do this was to
point the pointers to first index of the given array. Then in order to move the pointer to
the next data type index, I added 1 to one of the pointers. For an int, this will scoot the pointer
4 addresses over, a short 2 address, etc. Pointer subtraction returns the number of elements in 
between the addresses that pointers hold. Without casting this will return a 1, since we moved forward
one element worth of memory which can be more than 1 byte. In order to get the byte value we cast both 
pointers to char pointers (char*) and do pointer subtraction between the greater pointer and the smaller 
pointer, you get the number of chars inbetween those pointers, which is equivalent to the number of bytes

-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Explain:

The arguments of swap must both be pointers because if they were not pointers you would be passing copies
to the function and not references to the actual numbers you want to change. Therefore that memory does not
swap the integers you put in there. Swap pointers needs a reference to the memory you want to change, otherwise 
it will just create copies of the values given to it in new memory in order to perform its operations on the values

-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Positive Impact(s) and Drawback/Limitation(s):

There are good and bad things to starting out with a low level langauge

One immediate upside that I can think of is the fact that low level can be a lot to throw at someones for their 
first time programming. I for one would have a hard time having to think about pointers and over writing memory. 
Additionally, memory bugs would be a nightmare because you already dont have a great grasp for what could be going wrong
and C has terrible error messages compared to other languages. Also, Java syntax is smack dab in the middle of all languages, 
so I think that learning on that language makes it easier to transfer into other languages. 

An downside of not starting with a low level language however is that you lose out a much more foundational grasp of computing 
and a more natrual undersatnding of whats going on. This is a "Black Box" approach that is given in the 12x series. I 
personally would have liked a more low level introduction to things but that might be because I have an interest in this.
